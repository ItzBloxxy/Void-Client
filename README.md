# 🚀 Void Client (New!)

Void Client is a open-source, ultra lightweight tool to help you manage your **FFlags**, launch **Roblox**, and open the Roblox **file location** easily.

**Features:**

* ⚙️ Manage Roblox FFlags
* 🎮 Launch Roblox directly from the client
* 📂 Open Roblox installation folder with one click
* ✨ Simple and clean UI

**Note:** This is new, so expect ongoing updates and improvements! It’s my first time making an app, and I appreciate your patience as I keep learning and improving it over time! ❤️

**I can't make more buttons or uis because i'm having a annoying designer bug that can't be fixed in visual studio 2022 :C (tried everything)**
