# 🚀 Void Client (New!)

Void Client is a open-source, lightweight tool to help you manage your **FFlags**, launch **Roblox**, and open the Roblox **file location** easily.

**Features:**

* ⚙️ Manage Roblox FFlags
* 🎮 Launch Roblox directly from the client
* 📂 Open Roblox installation folder with one click
* ✨ Simple and clean UI

**Note:** This is a new project, so expect updates and improvements! It’s my first time making an app, and I appreciate your patience as I keep learning and improving it over time! ❤️

# This project is discontinued due to bitdancer's fault fflags don't exist anymore.
** only a small allow list!

**May still recieve some bug fix updates and that's it.

**I will work on a bloxstrap fork ig**
