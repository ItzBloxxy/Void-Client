# Annoucement
I’m excited to announce that I’m working on a new Fishstrap-based bootstrap called [BubbleStrap](https://github.com/ItzBloxxy/BubbleStrap).
It has many features and more coming ahead
Also it is faster and more lightweight than Fishstrap.

# 🚀 Void Client

Void Client is a open-source (outdated source gonna update it soon), lightweight app to help you manage your **FFlags**, launch **Roblox**, and open the Roblox **file location** easily.

**Features:**

* ⚙️ Manage Roblox FFlags 
* 🎮 Launch Roblox directly from the client
* 📂 Open Roblox installation folder with one click
* ✨ Simple and clean UI

This is a new project, so expect updates and improvements! It’s my first time making an app using **C#**, and I appreciate your patience as I keep learning and improving it over time! ❤️
